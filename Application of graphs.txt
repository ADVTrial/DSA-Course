Applications of graphs:

Social Networks:
Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn use graphs to represent relationships between users. Nodes represent individuals, and edges represent connections such as friendships or follow relationships.

Transportation Networks:
Road networks, flight routes, and public transportation systems can be modeled using graphs. Nodes represent locations (e.g., cities, airports, bus stops), and edges represent connections or routes between them.

Internet and Computer Networks:
The internet itself can be modeled as a graph, with nodes representing devices (e.g., routers, servers) and edges representing communication links. Graph algorithms are used for tasks like routing, network analysis, and optimization.

Recommendation Systems:
Recommendation systems in e-commerce, streaming platforms, and content websites use graphs to model user-item interactions. Nodes represent users and items, and edges represent user-item interactions (e.g., purchases, likes, views).

Bioinformatics:
Graphs are used in bioinformatics to model biological data, such as protein-protein interaction networks, genetic regulatory networks, and metabolic pathways. Nodes represent biological entities, and edges represent interactions or relationships between them.

Circuit Design and VLSI:
Graphs are used in circuit design and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) to model electronic circuits. Nodes represent components (e.g., transistors, gates), and edges represent connections or dependencies between components.

Recommendation Systems:
Graph databases use graphs to represent and store data, allowing for efficient querying and analysis of complex relationships. Examples of graph databases include Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, and Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS):
GIS applications use graphs to represent spatial data and networks, such as road networks, river networks, and utility networks. Nodes represent geographical features, and edges represent connections or relationships between features.

Knowledge Graphs:
Knowledge graphs represent structured knowledge by using nodes to represent entities (e.g., people, places, concepts) and edges to represent relationships or attributes between entities. They are used in search engines, virtual assistants, and data integration systems.

Game Theory and Optimization:
Graph algorithms are used in game theory for modeling strategic interactions between players and finding optimal strategies. They are also used in optimization problems such as shortest path routing, maximum flow, and minimum spanning tree.
