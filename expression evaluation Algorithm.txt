Expression Evaluation:
Algorithm to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack:

1.Initialize an empty stack to hold operands.
2.Scan the postfix expression from left to right.
3.For each element in the postfix expression:
    ->If the element is an operand, push it onto the stack.
    ->If the element is an operator:
	a. Pop the top two elements from the stack as operands.
	b. Perform the operation on these operands based on the 			   operator.
	c. Push the result back onto the stack.
4.After scanning the entire postfix expression, the result will be the only element left on the stack.
