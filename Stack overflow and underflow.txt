Stack overflow and underflow:

In the context of stacks, "overflow" and "underflow" refer to specific scenarios related to the capacity and emptiness of the stack, respectively.

Overflow:
---------
-Stack overflow occurs when an attempt is made to push an element onto a full stack. In other words, the stack has reached its maximum capacity and cannot accommodate any more elements.

-This situation typically arises in implementations of fixed-size stacks where the capacity is predefined. When the number of elements pushed onto the stack exceeds this predefined capacity, a stack overflow occurs.

-Stack overflow can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or errors in the program.

Underflow:
----------
-Stack underflow occurs when an attempt is made to pop an element from an empty stack. In other words, the stack is empty, and there are no elements to pop.

-This situation can arise when attempting to pop elements from an already empty stack or when trying to access elements from an uninitialized or uninitialized stack.

-Stack underflow can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or errors in the program.
